# Tasks

-[X] introduce main and classes probably with CMake!
-[ ] write a proper README.md file.
-[X] fix globing in CMakeLists.txt
-[X] Thin the herd and untrack unnecessary files e.g. build .vscode.
-[X] fix the build pipeline currently you need two consecutive builds to see changes in yac.
-[ ] start building the AST classes according to the instructor' instructions.
-[ ] augment Shadi's scanner.l with the previous scanner.l (our old scanner.l)

## Notes

 The pipeline is perfect!! now with shift+f5 you can generate the parsers and build the cpp files and run the project.
